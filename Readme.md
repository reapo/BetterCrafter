# BetterCrafter
Mod for the game "Starsand" which just came out on steam in early access.
## What does it do?
Automatically adds needed ingredients to the crafting queue if you have the needed items for it. No need to manually craft all smaller peaces of it anymore.

## How does it work?
This is a C# Mod using Harmony and BepInEx loader, so you need that installed in your games root folder.
You can then start the game with mods loaded by passing the following command line arguments:
`--doorstop-enable true --doorstop-target BepInEx\core\BepInEx.Preloader.dll`

Or use the modmanager to do all of that once i publich this on [Thunderstore](https://starsand.thunderstore.io/)

## Demo
Below you find a link to a short youtube video demonstrating the mod.
