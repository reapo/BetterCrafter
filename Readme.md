# BetterCrafter
Mod for the game "Starsand" which just came out on steam in early access.
## What does it do?
Automatically adds needed ingredients to the crafting queue if you have the needed items for it. No need to manually craft all smaller peaces of it anymore.

## How does it work?
### Using a Mod Manager
Install either [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) and install the mod from there.
### Manual Installation
You can follow the steps in the [BepInEx Docs](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) to setup BepInEx and then download [the release](https://github.com/sp00ktober/BetterCrafter/releases) and copy it into your plugins folder.
